# COMP9315 20T1 Sample Exam Q3

Type your answer(s) to replace the xxx's


(a) number of tuples per page in People table

each tuple need 1 bit + 32 bytes = 32 + 1/8 bytes
Total number of tuples per page = 4096 / (32 + 1/8) = 127


(b) number of pages in People table

number of pages = ceil(1234567/127) = 9721


(c) cost of duplicate removal using sorting

we need to firstly sort the relation, and then run a single pass for duplicate elimination
sort cost = 2 * 9721 * (1 + ceil(log100(ceil(9721/101)))) = 38884
scan cost = 9721
total = 48605

(d) cost of duplicate removal using hashing
Since there are 101 buffers, we use 100 partitions, then each partition occupies ceil(9721 / 100) = 98 pages
Hence, total cost = 2 * (98 * 100) + 9721 = 29321


(e) effect on hashing if only 91 buffers available
This would cause trouble, because 90*90 < 9721, which means each partition cannot be completely fix into buffer bool,
we can repeat the partition phase again, partition the pages into even smaller partitions and then do the duplicate elimination.
