a)
i) Is there a Courses tuple with id 1234?
No, from row=0 in the actual part.

ii) What is the total number of Courses tuples?
979 + 1 = 980

iii) What is the difference in how the two queries are evaluated?
The first query is a primary key type query, since there's an hash index build on primary key, it use index scan;
there's no index build on course code, hence the second query is sequencial scan

iv) Which query is the more efficient?
The first query is more efficient (from run time)

b)
i) get the number of assessment items for each course that has at least 1 assessment item, order by this count in descending order
ii) No, it can be seen from quicksort

c) 
i) there are 3 students
ii) 
People(id,title,family,given,address,gender,birthday,country)
Courses(id,code,title,uoc,convenor)
Enrolments(course,student,mark,grade)
-- aim find all students that fail the course SOMA1641, display field Student.id, Student.family, Enrolments.mark, Enrolments.grade

select s.id, s.family, e.mark, e.grade
from people as s, courses as c, enrolments as e
where s.id = e.student and c.id = e.course and c.code = 'SOMA1641' and e.grade = 'FL';
